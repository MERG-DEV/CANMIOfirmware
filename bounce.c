 * 
 * Handle the servo outputs. The output signal is a pulse between 1ms and 2ms where the width of the
 * pulse results in the servo moving to an angle. The outputs are driven by Timers to ensure that the
 * pulse width is accurate - although if interrupts are disabled then the width could be longer than
 * intended.
 * Pulses are output approximately every 20ms. Therefore we need more than 1 timer for all 16 possible 
 * servo outputs (16 * 2ms = 32ms which is greater than the 20ms available). A minimum of 2 timers 
 * (each handling 8 servos) is required but if we allow overdrive beyond 2ms then 3 (6 servos) or 
 * 4 (4 servos) timers is better.
 * Here we use 4 timers. Timer1..Timer4.
 * 
 * The timers are driven from Fosc/4 and use a 1:4 prescalar. With a 16MHz resonator and 4x PLL this 
 * equates to a timer increment every 0.25us. We require counts from 1ms to 2ms or 4000 - 8000 timer ticks.
 * We have an 8 bit position value and actually want to allow a bit of overdrive of the servo 0.9ms - 2.1ms.
 * (3600 ticks - 8400 ticks). This gives a range of 4800 ticks over the 8 bit range. Therefore each value
 * of the position is equivalent to 18.75 ticks - let's call it 19. The 3600 ticks at position 0 so to 
 * convert from position to ticks we need to use:
 *    Ticks = 3600 + 19 * position 
 * This is fine for the 16bit Timer1 and Timer3 but the 8 bit timers Timer2 and Timer4 need a bit more work.
